<p>In offering this little work upon Honiton Pillow Lace
Making, Madame Goubaud tenders her sincere thanks
for the reception accorded to her volume upon Point
Lace.</p>

<p>The great demand for Pillow Lace Instruction and
Designs has induced Madame Goubaud to begin this,
the first of a series upon Pillow Lace Making. Valenciennes,
Bedford, and Maltese laces will follow in due
course.</p>

<p>The materials required for Honiton Pillow Lace
work are neither numerous nor expensive. A pillow,
two dozen bobbins, some lace thread, a needle-pin, a
pair of <em>blunt</em> scissors, and a few pricked patterns or <em>passements</em>,
and lace pins are all the requisites for this useful
and beautiful work.</p>

<p>The pillows are made and sold at moderate prices
by Mrs. Mitchell, a Devonshire lace worker, at Long
Dean-street room in the Soho Bazaar, Oxford-street.
Mrs. Mitchell supplies bobbins, thread, passements,
and all requisites, as well as gives lessons in pillow-lace
making. The pillows can be obtained with plain
or handsome covers and cloths, and with wooden,
ivory, or ornamental bobbins. Learners will find it
useful to have their <em>leading</em> bobbins ornamented, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
distinction to the plain, until they have acquired the
art of working Honiton lace.</p>

<p>For braid-work Mecklenburg thread is used; No. 8
is a useful size to begin with for Honiton lace, No. 8
and 12 or 14 for very fine work; No. 8 is quite fine
enough for beginners to manage.</p>

<p>The pillows are always sent out fitted up, but to
change one design for another proceed as follows:—</p>

<p>Unpin the cloths, remove the passement; firmly pin
down the new passement with plain, not lace, pins; replace
the cloths, attach the bobbins to a pin about three-quarters
of an inch from the place intended to begin at,
divide the bobbins into three parts, and loosely plait down
to the first pinhole, insert a pin and work on as before.</p>

<h3><em>Nos. 1, 2, 3.—Braid Works and Passement.</em></h3>

<p>No. 1 shows a pretty braid for point lace work; this
braid consists of whole stitch and pearl.</p>

<p>No. 2 is the passement or pricking for a shamrock
spray.</p>

<p>No. 3 is a simple braid in whole stitch.</p>

<p>The first lesson usually given in pillow lace making is
the braid work; the learner is at first puzzled by the
number of fine bobbins, but if it is remembered that
only four are used together, and that the plain or whole
stitch is only weaving or plaiting across and back again,
the difficulty vanishes.</p>


<h3 id="braid"><em>Braid Work.</em></h3>

<p>Mecklenburg linen thread, No. 8, six pairs of bobbins.
For braid work three pairs of leaders are required. One
pair of leaders remains on each side separated by a pin;
work across and back again with the third pair thus:—Work
across, twist, make a stitch, twist <em>twice</em>, pin,
work back, twist twice, make stitch, twist twice, pin,
and repeat as before.</p>

<p>The lace pins are made expressly for the lace-workers
in Devonshire, and are sold in the old-fashioned paper
rows.</p>

<hr class="r65">

<h3><em>Nos. 4 and 5.—Passements.</em></h3>

<p>No. 4 is the passement or pricked design for a spade.</p>

<p>No. 5 is the passement of an old-fashioned sprig
formerly much in vogue among Honiton lace workers,
now seldom seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>The passements are pieces of brown parchment, having
the exact glazed pattern pricked out on them as shown
on pages 11, 13, and 15.</p>

<p>Ladies can easily prick them from the illustration. To
prick from lace itself it is necessary to keep the lace in
proper position and to place a pin in every pinhole along
the outlines, to mark any crossed threads by a pinhole,
and to show where lerd or lead-works occur by the
same means.</p>

<p>Great accuracy is necessary for this work, as all the
beauty of the lace depends on the correctness of the
prickings.</p>


<h3><em>Position in Working Pillow Lace.</em></h3>

<p>Devonshire workers usually sit on low chairs with
their feet on the back rail of another chair, resting their
pillow against the back of the chair. Ladies will find
that they can work most comfortably seated on an ordinary
chair with their feet on a footstool, and resting the
pillow against a table.</p>

<hr class="r65">

<h3><em>Nos. 6 and 7.—Passements.</em></h3>

<p>These are the passements for two useful lace sprays.</p>

<h3><em>Whole or Plain Pillow Lace Stitch.</em></h3>

<p>Four bobbins. No. 8 Mecklenburg thread. In order
to explain this stitch we must have recourse to numbers,
and mark the bobbins No. 1, 2, 3, 4, No. 1 being
the left-hand bobbin.</p>

<p>Pass No. 3 between Nos. 1 and 2; pass No. 1 over
No. 3; pass No. 2 over No. 4, and pass No. 4 between
Nos. 3 and 1.</p>

<p>Nos. 1 and 2 are the <em>leaders</em>, so called because they
lead across and back, weaving the <em>whole</em> or plain stitch
across, and in the pairs of leaders which form the edge
in lace braid and lace patterns. When one stitch is
completed, the two left-hand bobbins are dropped and
two bobbins taken from the right hand to make with the
two leaders the four bobbins necessary for each stitch.
Care must be taken that the bobbins are not twisted, but
that they lie each in its proper place. In beginning work
across from left to right of the pillow and back again.</p>

<hr class="r65">

<h3><em>Nos. 8 and 9.—Maltese Cross and Stem Work.</em></h3>

<p>No. 8 is a Maltese cross entirely executed in whole
or plain pillow lace stitch. This is a modern Honiton
design.</p>

<p>No. 9 is an enlarged illustration of stem work and
leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<h3 id="half"><em>Half Stitch.</em></h3>

<p>Mark the bobbins 1, 2, 3, 4, as for whole stitch. Pass
No. 3 between Nos. 1 and 2, pass No. 1 over No. 3,
pass No. 2 over No. 4, leaving No. 4 alone, and continue
with the next bobbins as in learning whole stitch. It
will be observed that half stitch is worked like whole
stitch <em>except</em> the last movement of passing No. 4 between
Nos. 3 and 1; to this omission the stitch owes its name.
Half stitch is used largely for the lighter parts of Honiton
lace, and is shown mixed in the rose, page <a href="#Page_43">43</a>.</p>


<h3 id="turn"><em>Devonshire Turn or Wheel</em></h3>

<p>To wind the threads on the bobbins a turn or wheel
is used. No. 10 shows a Devonshire turn. The
thread or cotton is always wound from right to left, and
a loop is made to prevent the bobbin from unwinding.
On gentle pressure the thread unwinds, but will hang in
place perfectly if the loop is made properly. All the
bobbins should be kept at the same length from the
pillow to which they are attached.</p>

<h3 id="stitch"><em>Honiton Lace Stitch.</em></h3>

<p>Honiton lace thread, No. 8 or No. 12 (No. 8 for
beginners), nine pairs of bobbins, one pair bobbins of
Mecklenburg thread No. 12, three pairs of leaders, one
Mecklenburg thread bobbin next each of the side leaders.
Work the third pair of leaders across, twist three times
plain stitch (the plain stitch is worked with the leaders
at each side left and right), twist three times, insert pin,
work back, twist three times, one plain stitch, twist
three times, pin.</p>

<p>This stitch is used for most of the Honiton patterns,
and the learner will observe that it is the same as braid
work, p. 12, only the leaders twist three times instead of
twice. No notice is taken of the Mecklenburg thread
bobbins: the leaders work over and under these as with
the ordinary bobbins.</p>

<hr class="r65">

<h3 id="cue"><em>Nos. 11 and 12.—Cue Borders.</em></h3>

<p>No. 11.—The cue border is worked from stem to
stem, with 7 pair. Take up a sewing with pins on
either side. 8 or 9 bobbins are used, according to if
cottons are worked or not.</p>

<p>No. 12.—Baby cue is worked in the same manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<h3 id="pattern"><em>To Form a Pattern.</em></h3>

<p>When the whole art and mystery of whole and half
stitch are acquired so as to be executed with mechanical
ease, the learner is naturally anxious to make some use
of her work, and to form a pattern. The trefoil design,
No. 8, is excellent to begin with, as it is less intricate
than many others.</p>

<p>In forming a pattern it will be observed that the outer
edge of the design has more pinholes than are in the
inner ring of the same design. The mode of decreasing
the number of pinholes is as follows:—* After making
the stitch, working across to the out rim and returning,
take out the last pin of the inner circle and use it for
the next pinhole stitch, thus making one pinhole and
pin serve for two stitches. After this variation in the
work, work backwards and forwards in the usual way
before repeating from *.</p>

<hr class="r65">

<h3><em>No. 13.—Rose Border.</em></h3>

<p>No. 13 shows a rose border, worked with 7
pairs without cottons, 8 pair with, commencing at the
stem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<h3 id="sewing"><em>To Take Up a Sewing.</em></h3>

<p>To perform this delicate operation a needle-pin is required;
this needle-pin is a fine long needle placed in a
wooden handle. The real Devonshire needle-pin is said
to be a No. 8 needle stuck in a lucifer-match.</p>

<p>With the needle-pin draw the thread through the edge
of the lace, pass the nearest bobbin through the loop
thus formed, tie, and work on as before.</p>


<h3 id="tying"><em>Throwing and Tying.</em></h3>

<p>These terms are used to express the mode of finishing
off any part of a sprig or design. To effect this:—Take
up two leaders and tie them in a plain knot, lay
them out right and left, throw all the bobbins in between
them again, tie in a plain knot, and either cut off the
bobbins or work on as directed.</p>

<h3><em>No. 14.—One Rose Border.</em></h3>

<p>No. 14. one-rose border, is a succession of rose
sprigs worked with seven pairs of bobbins without

<p>Snatch pin is used for joining the sprigs, and is worked
by the yard, and sewn on the sprigs as required in common
Honiton lace, but in best Honiton the sprays are
joined with snatch pin on the pillow.</p>

<p>Take four or five pairs of bobbins, according to the
width required, and work across, then twist six times,
insert a pin under one pair only, work back to the left
again, at the end twist six times as before, and repeat.</p>

<h3 id="pin"><em>Purl Pin.</em></h3>

<p>Purl pin or purling is used for connecting points of the
design and for joining sprigs.</p>

<p>Take five or six pairs of bobbins, or four pairs for
very fine work. Work across, twist the last two pairs
three times, work a stitch, twist each pair three times,
place the purl pin—that is, take up the last thread on the
pin by putting the pin under it—towards the worker, and
then in the pinhole, and lay the bobbin at the right
hand, cross the other leader over it the same way, twist
three times, work a stitch three times each pair, and work
away as before, repeating the purl pin on the opposite
side.</p>


<h3 id="edge"><em>Purl Edge</em></h3>

<p>is worked exactly in the same manner as purl pin, the
pins being set up on one side only, the other worked as

<h3 id="join"><em>To Join.</em></h3>

<p>Take a pair from each lerd mesh, make a stitch, put
up a pin, make a stitch, cross three times in readiness
for the next lerd work and work on with two pins as
before. Sewings are taken up at each side of the
space to be filled. These lerd works are worked in
rows.</p>


<h3 id="fillings"><em>Lerd Works or Fillings.</em></h3>

<p>Lead or lerd works or fillings are the names given
by Devonshire workers to the fine delicate work which
composes or fills up the centre of the flowers. These
fillings are of two kinds, diamond and square fillings.</p>

<p>The diamond filling is the easiest of the two kinds,
only good workers being able to work square fillings
properly.</p>

<hr class="r65">


<h3>No. 21.—<em>Violet Sprig.</em></h3>

<p>This violet differs from the old violet sprig, and is
often preferred on account of the speed with which it
can be worked. Work the leaf first, then the close
stem work, and finally the flower, taking up sewings at
all parts joining each other.</p>

<h3 id="diamond40"><em>Diamond Fillings.</em></h3>

<p>Begin with 4 bobbins, as in learning the whole stitch,
and number as before—1, 2, 3, 4.</p>

<p>Take up No. 2, hold it loosely, but do not let it go,
in the left hand, No. 4 over the thread, No. 3 up over
it, No. 1 out, forming a plait—<span class="allsmcap">IN, UP, OUT</span>. Moving
the No. 2 as you go, leaving the others lying in place
on the cushion except when actually moving them as
directed, draw up on the two outside threads, Nos. 1
and 4, and work on until you come to the pinhole.
Twist twice, put in a pin, twist both pairs twice, work
a stitch, twist twice. As many two pairs of bobbins
must be used as the space requires to fill properly;
the fillings are worked in rows, each two pair working
separately.</p>

<p>Two pairs of bobbins; increase as required according
to the size of space to be filled; one pair of bobbins.
Take up a sewing, pass the bobbin through, take a
second pair of bobbins; * work 12 stitches as shown in
diamond fillings. Take up a sewing and pass through
as before. Leave the right-hand pair until the next
lerd work is done; repeat from * with the next two pairs.</p>

<hr class="r65">


<h3>No. 23.—<em>Rose, Shamrock, and Thistle.</em></h3>

<p>This group is of modern Honiton design, and is
worked in whole stitch, half stitch, raised work, square,
stem work, fillings, in short, combines all Honiton lace
stitches.</p>

<h3 id="chain">No. 24.—<em>Beading or Chain.</em></h3>

<p>Beading is chiefly used as a band or finish for lace.
It is placed round the neck of collars, and serves as a
band by which they are tacked to the chemisette or to
the dress itself. It is used as insertion for ribbon velvet
to thread over and under in cheap made-up sets of
Honiton lace.</p>

<p>Use 8 or 10 pairs of bobbins, according to the size
of the cotton employed.</p>

<p>Divide the pairs of bobbins *, and lay one-half quite
away for the sake of clearness. These bobbins will be
called No. 2, and those about to be used No. 1. Work
across with No. 1 and back in the usual way until 2
pins are set up, as in stem-work, lay No. 1 bobbins
aside.</p>

<p>Take up No. 2, and work backwards and forwards
as before until 2 pins are set up on No. 2’s side. Then
work across twice as in plain braiding, so as to connect
the two sets of bobbins; repeat from *.</p>

<h3>No. 25.—<em>Trefoil Pattern.</em></h3>

<p>This simple pattern is so easy that beginners readily
master it in one lesson. It is whole stitch alone without
a pearl edge.</p>

<h3>No. 26.—<em>Fern Pattern.</em></h3>

<p>Work up the stem with plain stem work, turn the
pillow round, work down again leaf by leaf with pins
and sewings, plait up to the point of the leaf, taking up
sewings, throw and tie and come back as before, each
raised sewing to be worked in this way throughout the
whole leaf.</p>

<p>Leaves of any tree or plant may be copied in Honiton
lace, by taking a careful outline, marking the sewings, &amp;c.,
working the shadowed portion of the leaf in whole
stitch, the lighter in half, and the veinings in raised

<h3 id="sprigs"><em>Making up the Sprigs.</em></h3>

<p>Honiton lace is made up or joined in three different
ways—by purling, by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réseau</i> ground, and by application
on net. For all these modes a paper shape is cut and
the sprigs are arranged with great care right side
downwards. The purling is <em>sewn</em>, as we have already
stated, on inferior Honiton lace; in all superior pieces
it is joined on the pillow. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Réseau</i> ground is in imitation
of Brussels net worked by hand, as shown in No. 27.
It is worked stitch by stitch.</p>

<hr class="r65">


<h3>No. 27.—<em>Lappet in Honiton.</em></h3>

<p>This lappet is an illustration of the mode of making
up the sprigs. The one-rose sprigs are first tacked on
blue paper of the exact shape required, the butterfly is
placed in position, the fern sprig added, and the little
stem work sprig shown above and at the side of the
butterfly. The whole is then joined and filled in by a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réseau</i> ground in Brussels lace stitch.</p>

<h3>No. 28.—<em>Honiton Guipure Lace.</em></h3>

<p>No. 28 shows a beautiful specimen of Honiton
guipure lace, designed and worked by Mrs. Treadwin,
of Exeter, who has done more to win a taste for artistic,
natural forms than any other English lace designer. The
lace exhibited by Mrs. Treadwin in 1862 fully sustained
the reputation of Honiton lace, and bore comparison
with the most beautiful productions of France and
Belgium.</p>

<p>The specimen of guipure lace No. 28 is composed
of various sprigs of natural flowers and leaves joined
on the pillow with purling. Common Honiton guipure
is joined with purling worked by the yard and sewn on,
instead of being worked in on the pillow, as in this
specimen.</p>

<h3 id="honiton"><em>No. 29.—Honiton Appliqué.</em></h3>

<p><em>Appliqué</em> is the term given to this mode of joining
Honiton sprigs. The ground is composed of Brussels
net laid over the pattern prepared as above stated.
Every outline of the lace is carefully sewn to the
Brussels net; the net is afterwards cut away as shown
in illustration No. 29.</p>

<p>It is advisable that ladies should receive one or two
lessons in lace-making of Mrs. Mitchell, who is a quick
and clever teacher, and whose charges are extremely
moderate. Some ladies very soon master every class of
lace work, but a lesson will frequently prevent much
loss of time and patience.</p>

<p>“The Virgin Cork supplied by the London and Lisbon Cork-wood Company is taken from
the Company’s forests in Portugal, and is a delightful substitute for the old tree-roots and logs
of wood ordinarily used in making a fernery. It presents exactly the appearance required, as
it looks like moss-grown wood; it is light, and easily carried by ladies, as easily held in position
by a nail; it is porous, and not only absorbs, but retains moisture—a quality invaluable to
fern-growers.”</p>
</div>


<p class="center no-indent fs120 wsp">From the “Floral World and Garden Guide.”</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“It is sold by the Company at a remarkably cheap rate, and is unsurpassed for forming an
inside lining to summer-houses and grottoes; indeed, for this purpose it is impossible to say too
much in its praise. It is light, clean, and durable; indeed, the common bark used for this
purpose bears no comparison with it.”</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs120 wsp">From the “Villa Gardener.”</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“For balconies, where lightness of material is always a desideratum, this Cork is invaluable,
and it can be had in designs as varied as can be conceived. We can have it manufactured into
bridges, flower-stands, rustic houses in glass, brackets for standing plants upon and for
window-boxes.”</p>

<p>“There are few prettier ornaments for a sitting-room than stands made from the first bark
stripped from the Cork tree. This has been recently introduced into this country for garden
purposes, for which it has proved to be admirably adapted, more particularly for growing ferns,
orchids, and other plants of a similar nature. In appearance it resembles moss-grown wood,
and no doubt will supersede those stands in imitation of bark made of terra-cotta now so much
used for fern-cases, flower-stands, &amp;c.”</p>
